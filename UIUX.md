- Firstly, there's the user booking interface. Since house information and reviews can be lengthy, on larger screens, as the list scrolls, the booking section is always kept at the top-right corner for easy access to the subscription button. Similarly, when a house owner manages their booking list, I keep the rental information at the top-right corner for easy reference.

- All logos, when clicked, redirect back to the main page, including the login and register sections.

- On the landing page, like the hosting page, all information is provided, including rent, bedrooms, and bathrooms, etc., giving users a general understanding of the house right from this interface.

- In the booking interface, there is a 'show all photos' button. Clicking it displays all photos in full screen, and buttons at the bottom allow users to quickly jump to the end or the beginning of the photo list.

- For the hosting settings interface, I made many fields as 'select' options to facilitate easier user input.
